This project is a small, educational program built with Python that acts like a simplified Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. Its main job is to read and analyze security records from a Windows computer to find evidence of attacks or suspicious activity. 

Why This Project is Important
This simulator is a fantastic tool for learning about cybersecurity because it gives you hands-on experience with the fundamentals:

Understanding Attacker Behavior: You learn exactly what attackers do (like clearing logs or using PowerShell) and what to look for.

Coding Security Logic: You see how security rules are written in Python code using Regular Expressions for data matching.

The SIEM Workflow: You get practical knowledge of how a real SIEM takes raw data, processes it, and turns it into actionable security alerts.
